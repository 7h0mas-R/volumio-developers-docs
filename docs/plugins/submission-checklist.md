## Why a checklist for plugin submission

Volumio's plugin system is designed to allow a great degree of freeom for plugins developers, and we are committed to keep it that way. On the other hand, plugins shall be safe to use and don't compromise the stability of the system.
This is why every plugin, before being accepted, MUST pass a series of compliance tests.

Before submitting a plugin, make sure your plugin satisfies all the subsequent requirements.
